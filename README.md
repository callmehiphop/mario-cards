Mario-Cards
===========

This is a re-creation of the card flip game from Super Mario Bros. 3, it's also based off of <https://github.com/IgorMinar/Memory-Game>

Play here <http://callmehiphop.github.io/mario-cards/index.html>

or..

Install it by doing the following

```
# Use `package.json` to pull down dependencies from npm
$ npm install

# Use `component.json` to pull down dependencies from bower
$ bower install
```

After you have all the dependencies installed, all that is left is to run `grunt server`!
